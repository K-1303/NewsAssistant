On 21 February, we appealed to farmers to maintain peace while marching to Delhi. But some cops were in civil dress and they instigated farmers. Some farmers asked them to stop, and then they used tear gas to attack the farmers. Another farmer, Pritpal, was abducted and taken to the Haryana side. They have killed four of our farmer brothers”.\\\\n\\\\nAbhimanu Kohard said Shubhkaran\\\\\\'s body will be brought to the Khanauri border after an autopsy. \"We will remember 21 Feb as Martyrdom day of Shubhkaran,\" he added.\\\\n\\\\nHe also reiterated the farmers\\\\\\' demand for a legal gurantee for Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their crops.\\\\n\\\\n“We just want the Prime Minister to fulfil his promise on MSP guarantee. Why are the victims of Lakhimpur Kheri not getting justice? Haryana police behaved like General Dyer. You can invoke false FIR and NSA on us, but please don\\\\\\'t kill farmers,\" said the farmer leader.\\\\n\\\\nHe said the Haryana Police should bring proof if they allege that the farmers attacked them. Kohard also questioned who the people were who wore civilian clothes and broke cars and tractors.\\\\n\\\\nPublished By:\\\\n\\\\nchingkheinganbi mayengbam\\\\n\\\\nPublished On:\\\\n\\\\nFeb 23, 2024\\\\n\\\\nMust Watch\\\\n\\\\nIN THIS STORY\\\\n\\\\n#Farmers’ Protest\\\\n\\\\nWatch Live TV\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nAlso Watch\\\\n\\\\n0:26\\\\n\\\\nVideo: PM uses virtual reality headset to inspect Kashi ropeway in Varanasi\\\\n\\\\n0:50\\\\n\\\\nSandeshkhali protest: What BJP MP Locket Chatterjee said after being detained?\\\\n\\\\n1:06\\\\n\\\\nVideo: Newlyweds Rakul Preet-Jackky Bhagnani make stylish appearance at Goa airport\\\\n\\\\n0:58\\\\n\\\\nWatch: 14-storey apartment ablaze, fire spread to adjacent building in Spain\\\\n\\\\n0:40\\\\n\\\\nVideo: Singapore airshow takes flight with spectacular aerial displays\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\\\n\\\\nRead This\\\\n\\\\n\\\\\\'Delhi Chalo\\\\\\' march paused for night after day of violence, over 60 injured\\\\n\\\\nWatch: Ashok Chavan’s blooper, Devendra Fadnavis corrects him, bursts of laughter\\\\n\\\\n1 dead, 21 injured in Kansas City after shooting during Super Bowl victory rally\\\\n\\\\n‘Congress doesn’t deserve but we’ll offer 1 seat’: AAP’s take-it-or-leave-it\\\\n\\\\nEx-Maharashtra Chief Minister Ashok Chavan joins BJP, day after quitting Congress\\\\n\\\\nAdvertisement\\', metadata={\\'source\\': \\'https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/farmers-protest-haryana-kheri-chopta-stone-pelting-leaders-detained-tear-gas-ground-report-2506378-2024-02-23\\'})]'"
